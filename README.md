# Pneumonia-SARS-COVID19-in-X-Ray-Images-
we have been collecting 292 samples of the chest x-ray images. They were normalized with size 700Ã—800 pixels and adjust the intensity by histogram equalization. Every image is checked by a respiratory doctor in Ad Diwaniya consulate education hospital in Iraq to diagnose positive (has pneumonia disease) or negative (normal)
